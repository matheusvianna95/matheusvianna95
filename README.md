### Hey! I'm Matheus Vianna, an Android developer in training
:speech_balloon: I like to ironically consider myself a specialized generalist as I have extensively studied topics in nanotechnology, industrial engineering and civil aviation. Among other things I have done research on Zinc nanoparticle properties, worked on a social entrepreneurship project and flown a little over 42 hours on a Piper PA-28 Cherokee. <br>
It turns out I have never graduated in any of those fields and ended up falling in love and finding my passion in software development during a pandemic.         <sub>I hope that's allowed.</sub>

:milky_way: **I'm working on [MarsGaze](https://github.com/MarsGaze/MarsGaze)** with some friends as part of a mobile development course we are currently enrolled in. <br>
It consumes some of NASA's APIs to display Mars' surface pictures taken by Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity, 7-day weather data by InSight and some cool pictures from NASA's archives. <br>
Our main objective is learning modern Android development practices including Jetpack libraries and MVVM architecture.

No he did not fight in the Clone Wars or the Galactic Civil War. <br>
He will smuggle your left shoe away though...</em></sub></p>
